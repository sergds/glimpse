# Glimpse NextBot
Based on Inside The Backrooms Smiler's behaviour.

Appears in dark/not seen, reachable areas. Waits glimpse_staretime in that place for a victim and them picks a new place.

While seen by a player, the glimpse will deplete player's health. (psychic damage)

If touched by a player, player will be killed (dissolved) if glimpse_lethal_touch is set to 1
